# Scaling



Some starting point recommendations:

* 256MB is enough to run small applications with few users
* 512MB is a better place to start if you are doing image processing or have a moderate number of users.
* 1024MB is a minimum if you are running an application that uses puppeteer or otherwise makes use of chrome’s rendering engine.

A good starting point may be 512MB of RAM and 1024MB of swap.
