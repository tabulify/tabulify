====== Data Definition File (DataDef.yml) ======


===== About =====
A ''data definition'' file is a file that describes the data to be generated.

This is an option of the ''fill'' action such as:
  * [[table:fill]]
  * [[schema:fill]]

<wrap info>
The sample schema comes automatically with their own data, therefore the [[sample:fill|sample schema fill]] does not offer this option.
