====== Bytle Db - TPC-DS ======


===== About =====
''Bytle Db'' supports the [[http://www.tpc.org/tpcds/|Tpc-Ds]] database benchmark on the following points:
  * the creation of schema (tables)
  * the creation/load of data
  * the execution of queries



===== Operations =====
==== Creation of schema ====
With the action [[create|schema create]], you can create the following schema's
  * ''tpcds'' - all ''TPC-DS'' tables
  * ''tpcds-dwh'' - the data-warehouse tables
  * ''tpcds-store-sales'' -  the store sales schema (a data-warehouse schema)
  * ''tpcds-stg'' - the staging tables


Example:
  * To be sure to start with a fresh state, we will [[drop|drop the sample schema]]
<unit>
<code dos>
db sample drop tpcds-store-sales
</code>
</unit>
<unit>
  * Then we create a new one
<code dos>
db sample create tpcds-store-sales
</code>
<console>
Table (date_dim) created.
Table (item) created.
Table (customer_address) created.
Table (time_dim) created.
Table (customer_demographics) created.
Table (income_band) created.
Table (dbgen_version) created.
Table (store) created.
Table (promotion) created.
Table (household_demographics) created.
Table (customer) created.
Table (store_sales) created.
</console>
</unit>

==== Crestion of data ====

To fill our schema with generated data, we will use the [[fill|fill sub-command of the sample module]].

<unit>
<code dos>
db sample fill tpcds-store-sales
</code>
