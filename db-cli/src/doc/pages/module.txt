====== Bytle Db - Module ======

===== About =====
A module in [[db|Bytle-Db Cli]]  is the first word that follows the [[db|db]] executable.


They represent generally a data structure where we can perform [[action|action (also known as command)]].

===== Syntax =====
A module is called by adding its name after the [[db|db]] word.


<code dos>
db module ...
</code>

===== List =====

[[db|db]] provides actually the following modules:
  * [[table:table|table]] - operations on one or more table
  * [[schema|schema]] - operations on one or more schema
  * [[database|database]] - operations on a database
  * [[query|query]] - operations on one or more queries
  * [[sample|sample]] - operations on sample schema (database)
  * [[fkey|fkey]] - operations on foreign keys (ie relationship between tables)


To get the list of modules for your [[db|db]] version from the console, you would call the [[help|help]] on the [[db|db]] cli.

Example:

<unit>
<code dos db_help.cmd>
db --help
</code>
<file>
A Sdk for the database

Syntax:

	db [options] <command>

		* table             operations on one or several tables
