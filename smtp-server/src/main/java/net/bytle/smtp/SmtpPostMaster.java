 * SMTP systems are expected to make every reasonable effort to accept
 * mail directed to Postmaster from any other system on the Internet.
 * In extreme cases --such as to contain a denial of service attack or
 * other breach of security-- an SMTP server may block mail directed to
 * Postmaster.  However, such arrangements SHOULD be narrowly tailored
 * so as, to avoid blocking messages which are not part of such attacks.
