            The device id (a uuid4 or a fingerprint for instance)

            It's also known as the user anonymous id because this is the user identifier
            when the user is unknown.

            When you send a message, a userId or a deviceId is required in order to identify a user.

            We prefer the term device id (mixpanel) over anonymous id (segment) because it's
            more meaningful. We track the device.

            It's created on the client side and stored by the client more permanently
            (via a cookie for the browser and stored in local storage for durability).

            It's not the same as a session id because:
            * a session id may be regenerated (when the user sign in for instance).
            * the device id does not have any security feature. You can't login

            It is the global identifier
            * a string representation of realm id + user local id
            * never changes.
            It's the public id that:
            * you can see in the url
            * send to external application such as Analytics SAAS provider.

            The database id (ie realm id + user local id) is not public.

            The user id in the realm in the database (ie local to the realm)

            We have called it local to avoid to really indicate
            that is not the true id.

            You can't check with this id if this is the same user
            as this is the id inside the realm, there is other id
            with the same value in another realm.

        A realm.

        It identifies a protection space where the user and their credentials
        are stored.

        * In a marketing level, it represents a brand. When people log in, they see the realm logo.
        * In a web/dns level, it would be a domain name (and apps would be subdomain)
        * In a security level, this is the authentication realm.
        * In an infrastructure level, this is called a tenant.
