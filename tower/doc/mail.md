# Mail


## Dev
* install PaperCut all emails are sent to the local smtp host.

Note the `paper cut` client does not read the email that
are received when it's not open. (The smtp server takes them,
but you will not see them in the client)

Rules can be added such as `Regex Header Match` rule to
forward the email.
