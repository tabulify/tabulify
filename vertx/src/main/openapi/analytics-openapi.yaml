    AnalyticsEvent:
      description: |
        The event. They are the things that happen in our product.

        We follow a mix of
        * the <a href="https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/common/">Segment Spec</a>
        * the <a href="https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/common/">MixPanel Spec</a>

        All properties are on the same level, no hierarchy (as MixPanel do)

        The extended property should have as prefix, the name of the event
        Example: for signUp, signUpFlowId
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          description: |
            A unique identifier for each event.

            It allows to delete duplicate.

            It's known for:
            * segment as messageId
            * mixpanel as $insert_id
        name:
          type: string

            If the user is not anonymous, it is the user audience.
        appOrganisationId:
          type: string
          description: the organization id (the billing logical unit, known also as the group id)
        properties:
          description: The additional event properties
          additionalProperties:
            type: object # may be number, string, boolean
        deviceId:
          type: string
          description: |
            The device id (a uuid4 or a fingerprint for instance)

            It's also known as the user anonymous id because this is the user identifier
            when the user is unknown.

            When you send a message, a userId or a deviceId is required in order to identify a user.

            We prefer the term device id (mixpanel) over anonymous id (segment) because it's
            more meaningful. We track the device.

            It's created on the client side and stored by the client more permanently
            (via a cookie for the browser and stored in local storage for durability).

            It's not the same as a session id because:
            * a session id may be regenerated (when the user sign in for instance).
            * the device id does not have any security feature. You can't login
